I've actually been enjoying teaching online during Covid-19.  Besides
the ability to have a soundtrack/theme (Between Two Ferns) and sound
effects (applause and various boing noises from a midi keyboard), I've
enjoyed using [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) a lot.  Below is a
schematic diagram of the setup I use for teaching using OBS and Zoom
Pro:
