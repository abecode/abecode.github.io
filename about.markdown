This is my Github Homepage and blog.  Right now it's still under
construction.  I have [an older
blog](https://abewrites.wordpress.com/) and a [plain old
aws/html/nginx homepage](https://abe.kazemzadeh.org).

When I'm not dinking around with computers, I profess about them at
[the University of St. Thomas Graduate Programs in
Software](https://www.stthomas.edu/gradsoftware/).

For more info about how this site was made, please see [the Github
Jekyll
docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
and [Jekyll docs at jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
